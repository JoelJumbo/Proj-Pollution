# Proj-Pollution
python program that recollects pollution data from the web, saves it in a maria database and display custom data to users of a web page based on their location
The Project is still unfinished. 
- Right now it uses a massive dataset that due to its size it can't be imported into github so I will change the project so that it collects data from the web.
